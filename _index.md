     box86 is targeted towards 32bits.
     While compatibility and speed can be improved, the support of 16bits code (for Wine) is probably the last missing feature for box86.
     <br>
     After that, box64 will be targeted toward 64bits apps.
     It will be a different application, and will allow similar principles with native use of ARM64 native libs directly on x86_64 linux apps.
